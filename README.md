SmartByte aims to improve people's restaurant consuming methods. Consumers need to consider
many factors when choosing the best menu item from a place, however, SmartByte solves this
issue by choosing the best menu items for them.

This is accomplished through several algorithms that calculate the consumer's total daily
recommended calories and protein. This is done by getting a few measurements from the consumer,
such as age, weight, height, and gender. SmartByte also asks the consumer for their goal, whether
it be losing weight, building muscle, or just maintaining a balance.

SmartByte also utilizes your proximity to nearby restaurants, so you can select restaurants
to order from that are near you. Once a restaurant is selected, the best menu items for you
are displayed.
