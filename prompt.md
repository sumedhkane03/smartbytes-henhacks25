# Nutrition Data System Integration Challenge

You are GitHub Copilot, assisting with designing and implementing a nutrition data system that integrates information from two different APIs with complementary data:

## API Sources
- **Nutritionix API**: Provides reliable calorie information for food items
- **API Ninjas**: Provides macronutrient data (fats and carbs) but lacks protein data

## Technical Challenge
Develop a robust protein content estimation system that handles API limitations while maintaining data consistency.

## Required Estimation Methods (in fallback order)
1. **Caloric Differential Method**:
    - Calculate protein based on: `(Total calories from Nutritionix) - (Calories from fats/carbs from API Ninjas)`
    - Convert remaining calories to protein grams (using 4 cal/g protein conversion)

2. **Food Category Recognition**:
    - Implement classification for identifying common high-protein items
    - Apply category-specific protein percentage estimates based on food type

3. **Nutritional Science Approximation**:
    - Use established macro ratios for different food types
    - Apply nutritional science formulas to estimate reasonable protein values

4. **Data Reconciliation Layer**:
    - Resolve inconsistencies between data sources
    - Handle API failures gracefully
    - Validate results against reference nutritional ranges

## Implementation Needs
Please provide code examples, data structures, API integration patterns, and error handling strategies to implement this system effectively while working within free API tier limitations.
